# Freelance Marketplace API

This is a RESTful API for a **Freelance Marketplace**, developed in **Java Spring Boot**, using **PostgreSQL** as the database and **RabbitMQ** for asynchronous processing. It provides endpoints for managing freelancers, jobs, and comments.

My deployed instance on Render.com(it will take a few seconds to boot up): [https://freelancemarketplace.onrender.com/swagger-ui/index.html#/](https://freelancemarketplace.onrender.com/swagger-ui/index.html#/)
## Features

- **Freelancer Management**: Create, list, and search freelancers. Freelancer type can only be (`SOFTWARE_DEVELOPER` or `DESIGNER`)
- **Job Management**: Assign jobs to freelancers, update or fetch job details. Job status can only be (`IN_PROGRESS`, `CANCELLED`, `FINISHED`)
- **Comment System**: Users can post comments on jobs.
- **Asynchronous Evaluation System**: When a new freelancer is created, an evaluation job is sent through **RabbitMQ** to score them asynchronously.
- **Database Seeding**: Automatically seeds the database with sample freelancers, jobs, and comments.(If the DB is empty)

## RabbitMQ Integration

When a new freelancer is created, a message is published to a RabbitMQ queue to **calculate an evaluation score asynchronously**. This helps to offload compute-heavy tasks without delaying user responses.

---

## Docker Support

You can containerize the application and database using Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Make sure your `.env` file includes:
```
DB_HOST=your_dbhost
DB_PORT=your_db_port
DB_NAME=your database name
DB_USERNAME=yourusername
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword

RABBITMQ_HOST=your_rabbit_host
RABBITMQ_USERNAME=your_rabbit_user
RABBITMQ_PASSWORD=your_rabbit_pass
RABBITMQ_PORT=5671
```

## Postman Collection and Swagger

The API can be tested using the [Postman Collection](https://cloudy-robot-2897016.postman.co/workspace/%C5%9Eehran-Kartal's-Workspace~9c0b2215-fd79-4fc9-8227-dec40ddf544c/collection/43476226-045b7f1d-7667-483f-a44d-eb6e4c1905ef?action=share&source=collection_link&creator=43476226).

Or after running the api locally [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/)

Or even on my deployed instance on Render.com(it will take a few seconds to boot up): [https://freelancemarketplace.onrender.com/swagger-ui/index.html#/](https://freelancemarketplace.onrender.com/swagger-ui/index.html#/)
